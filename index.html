        <p>Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of your eligible trade-in device.
            Not all  devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least 18  years old to be eligible to trade in for
            credit or for an   Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward  qualifying new device purchase, or
            added to an   Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt  of a qualifying device matching the
            description provided  when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on  full value of a new device
            purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may require saving this
            information). Offer may not be available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online trade-in.
            Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or
            limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available from Appleâ€™s trade-in
            partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
            Apple Vision Pro has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission.
            This device is not, and may not be, offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is
            obtained.
            Apple Vision Pro will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple retail stores in the U.S.
            To access and use all Apple Card features and products available only to Apple Card users, you must add
            Apple Card to Wallet on an iPhone or iPad that supports and has the latest version of iOS or iPadOS. Apple
            Card is subject to credit approval, available only for qualifying applicants in the United States, and
            issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch.
            If you reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about Apple
